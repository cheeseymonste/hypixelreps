                    <div class="answerstatement"></a>Well, we will answer that below:</div>
                    <div class="whatitis"><a name="whatisreptrader"></a>What is  Reputation Trader?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A Reputation Trader (also called a rep trader) is a player that will upgrade your items /gear /inventory for free, and
                         in return, you will give them a reputation (also called rep). A reputation can vary from player to player, 
                         but in our case, it will be leaving positive feeback on our website as seen on our <a href="hypixelrep.html" class="link-underline">homepage</a>. See below for more answered questions. :)
                    </div>
                    <div class="whatitis"><a name="rep"></a>What is a Reputation?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A Reputation, also called a Rep, is where a player gives another player
                        a good rating on the Hypixel Skyblock Community. This is usually because of another player upgrading their items for free or another 
                        way of thanking a player
                        for being trustworthy, kind, or in our case, Myself or Explorar2 upgrading your items for free. This is used in the Hypixel Skyblock community
                         to gain trust or to gain customers.
                         For exapmle, paid dungeon carries because they require some reputation in the community to do, as you need to be trusted by the community so that you do not scam the players for exapmle,
                         not meeting the requirements to carry, or being unable to give players a completion for the run. In addition giving very bad service. Myself and Explorar2 are trying to
                         increase our reputation in the Hypixel Skyblock Community to gian popularity and Trust on the server. We also want to help players out so we 
                         have created this website so that you can give us a reputation and so that you can level up faster in the game. See below for more answered questions. :)
